Build A Restful Api With Node.js Express &amp; MongoDB

build a simple blog post type api with all the useful methods(GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH).

I use Node.js as backend language, express.js is going to help create routes easier and middlewares and I use mongodb together 
with mongoose to create schemas and models that define how our data looks.
